             <h1 id="active">Company background</h1>
             <p>The start of company was inspired my father. My father was inspired by my grandfather who used to work at a mine, so he would occasionally take my father along with him to work. That is how he developed his interest in collecting stones. Growing up in a family that was big on collecting gems, I fell in love with the industry myself. When a fatal accident claimed the lives of my parents, I felt a burning passion inside me to carry on the legacy, so I took over from my father and decided to formally start this business.<p/>
